Pizza Factory Pattern
===============================

*The Factory Patterns* 
*Factory Method Pattern*
The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses. The abstract creator acts on the abstract product. The concrete creators create concrete products.

Indications
-----
* You need to program to concrete classes, yet you want to manage the change around those classes (keeping the classes closed to modification).

Refactoring Steps
-----
* p. 114: Pizza shop makes one type of pizza.
* p. 114: Need more than one type of pizza... Code is _not_ closed for modification. Have to modify the existing code to add new types of pizza.
* p. 116: Encapsulate what changes. In this case, it's the creation of the the pizza types. The operations that follow (prepare, bake, etc.) remain the same for all pizzas. This encapsulation is a factory. orderPizza() does not need to know how to assemble a pizza, so it will delegate this action to the SimplePizzaFactory.
* p. 117: Could define a simple factory as a static method, called a static factory, but could not then subclass and change behavior of the create method.
* p. 119: HFDP Honorable Mention: This simple factory is _not_ the Factory Pattern, but a programming idiom.
* p. 121: Franchising! Need two new styles of pizza: New York and Chicago. First the naive way... two new simple factories.
* p. 122: Moving CreatePizza() to Pizzeria and making both abstract. Each regional pizzeria is going to subclass.
* p. 125: "...OrderPizza() method in the superclass has no clue which Pizza we are creating;"
* p. 127: "All the responsibility for instantiating Pizzas has been moved into a *method* that acts as a *factory*."
