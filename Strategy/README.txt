Strategy Pattern (SimUDuck)
================
- p. 3 Joe adds the flying duck behavior using inheritance (genius!).
- p. 4 FAIL: Rubber ducks should not fly, so inheritance is not the answer.
- p. 6 Joe proposes a flying interface, but this means the flying behavior is not reusable, and needs to be maintained separately across every duck.
