Weather-O-Rama Observer Pattern
===============================

*The Observer Pattern* defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

New OO Principles
-------------------
1. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

Refactoring Steps
-----
* p. 39: "Our job, if we choose to accept it, is to create an app that uses the WeatherData object to update three displays for current conditions, weather stats, and a forecast."
* p. 43: Coding to concrete implementations.
* p. 51-2: Refactoring to use Observer Pattern.
  * Added ISubject and IObserver interfaces.

Lessons
-------
* Loose Coupling
  * Loosely coupled objects can interact but have very little knowledge of each other.
  * Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects.
