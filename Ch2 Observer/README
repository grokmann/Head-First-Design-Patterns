Weather-O-Rama Observer Pattern
===============================



*The Observer Pattern*

Relevant OO Principles
-------------------
1. Encapsulate what varies.
2. Favor composition over inheritance.
3. Program to interfaces, not implementations.

Refactoring Steps
-----
* p. 39: "Our job, if we choose to accept it, is to create an app that uses the WeatherData object to update three displays for current conditions, weather stats, and a forecast."

Lessons
-------
* HAS-A (_composition_) can be better than IS-A (_inheritance_).
