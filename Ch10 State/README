State Pattern
===============================

*The State Pattern* allows an object to alter its behavior
when its internal state changes. The object will appear to
change its class.

Indications
-----
* A system has behavior that changes depending on conditions.
* You need the flexibility to add additional behaviors in the future.

Refactoring Steps

* p. 394: The initial code is very procedural/imperative.
* p. 402: Change request to add 1 in 10 winner of free gumball. 
* p. 404: "This code would make a FORTRAN programmer proud." ☺
* p. 405: Frank & Judy's plan:
	* Try to localize behavior for each state: "encapsulate what varies." 
	* Put each state's behavior in its own class—then each state can implement its own actions. 
	* Maybe Gumball Machine can delegate to the state object that represents the current state: "favor composition."
* p. 406: The New Design
	1. Define a State interface with a method for every action in the Gumball Machine.
	2. Implement a State class for every state, which will be responsible for behavior of machine when in the corresponding state.
	3. Get rid of conditional code and delegate work to State classes.
* p. 411: Complete GumballMachine class.
* p. 418: State Pattern definition and class diagram.
	* The Context is the class that can have a number of internal states, e.g. GumballMachine.
* p. 419: Class diagrams for the Strategy and State Patterns are the same. They vary in _intent_.
	* State Pattern
		- Set of behaviors encapsulated in state objects, which context delegates to.
		_ The client usually knows very little, if anything, about the state objects.
		- An alternative to putting lots of conditionals in your context.
	* Strategy Pattern
		- The client usually specifies the strategy object that the context is composed with.
		- While the pattern provides the flexibility to change the strategy at runtime, often there is a strategy object that is most appropriate for a context object.
		- A flexible alternative to subclassing.
* p. 420: Q&A
	* When the state transitions are fixed, they are appropriate for putting in the Context; when transitions are more dynamic, typically placed in concrete state classes themselves. The designer is deciding which classess are closed for modification—the Context or the state classes—as the system evolves.
