Iterator Pattern
===============================

*The Iterator Pattern* 

Indications
-----
* You have objects in a collection the clients want to iterate over, but you don't want the clients to have access to the implementation.

New OO Principles

Refactoring Steps
-----
* p. 324-5: The Diner and Pancake Houses agree on the MenuItem class...
* p. 326-7: ...but each has implemented the menu differently. The Pancake House uses ArrayList, and the Diner uses Array, and each have menu methods dependent on their own implementations. Note: C# ArrayList behaves differently from Java's (need to re-cast the generic objects in C#).
* p. 328: The Java-enabled waitress has a specification which can be achieved using the Iteration Pattern.
* p. 329: GetMenuItems() requires two loops. If another restaurant with a different implementation is acquired then we'll have _three_ loops.
* p. 331: Even with a for loop, Waitress still needs to know about the type of each menu. Need to decouple the Waitress from the concrete implementations of the menus completely.
* p. 332: Encapsulate what varies: in this case, that's the iteration over MenuItems.
