Template Method Pattern
===============================

*The Template Method Pattern* defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets su subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

Indications
-----
* You have duplicated code due to a common algorithm or process.
* You want to enforce a standard process or algorithm, while allowing flexibility in one or more steps. 

New OO Principles
-------------------
1. The Hollywood Principle: Don't call us, we'll call you.


Refactoring Steps
-----
* p. 285-6: Adding Coffee and Tea. BoilWater() and PourInCup() are the exact same methods for both classes.
* p. 290-3: Abstracting PrepareRecipe(). Added CaffeineBeverage superclass.
* p. 294: PrepareRecipe() is our _template method_.
* p. 299-30?: Adding a hook.
* p. 309-12: Adding comparable Duck.

Lessons
-------
* When we've got code duplication, that's a good sign we need to clean up the design.
* A template method is a method that serves as a template for an algorithm. Some methods are handled by the superclass class, and some are handled by the subclasses.
* A _hook_ is a method that is declared in the abstract class, but only given an empty or default implementation. This gives subclasses the ability to "hook into" the algorithm at verious points, if they wish; a subclass is free to ignore the hook.
* A hook can provide a subclass the ability to make a decision for the abstract class.
* The Hollywood Principle prevents dependency rot. With the Hollywood Principle, we allow low-level components to hook themselves into a system, but the high-level components determine when they are needed, and how.
* Implementing CompareTo() for IComparable is an example of the Template Method Pattern.
