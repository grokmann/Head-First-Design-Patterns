Template Method Pattern
===============================

*The Template Method Pattern* defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets su subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

Indications
-----
* You have duplicated code due to a common algorithm or process.
* You want to enforce a standard process or algorithm, while allowing flexibility in one or more steps.

Refactoring Steps
-----
* p. 285-6: Adding Coffee and Tea. BoilWater() and PourInCup() are the exact same methods for both classes.
* p. 290-3: Abstracting PrepareRecipe(). Added CaffeineBeverage superclass.
* p. 294: PrepareRecipe() is our _template method_.

Lessons
-------
* When we've got code duplication, that's a good sign we need to clean up the design.
* A template method is a method that serves as a template for an algorithm. Some methods are handled by the superclass class, and some are handled by the subclasses.
