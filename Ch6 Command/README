Command Pattern
===============================

*The Command Pattern* 
The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue, or log requests, and support undoable operations.

Indications
-----
* There is a need to decouple the requester of an action from the object that actually performs the action.

New OO Principles
-------------------
1. None.

Lessons
-------
* Pattern Honorable Mention: The NoCommand object is an example of a null object, which is useful when you don't have a meaningful object to return, and yet you want to remove from the client the responsibility for handling null. Sometimes Null Object is listed as a design pattern.
